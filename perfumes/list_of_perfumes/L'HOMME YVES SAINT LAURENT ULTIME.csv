He will let you into his world, but he'll keep part of it for himself. He is authentic, and his desires, carnal. He walks with a self-assuredness, in the knowledge that people are watching. His charisma is intoxicating. Wild and free, he lives intensely but never loses control. He is a vital force, connected to the world around him - but also distant, untouchable.","['Vetiver', 'Geranium', 'Rose (Turkey)', 'Cedarwood', 'Grapefruit', 'Cardamom', 'Ciste Labdanum', 'Ginger', 'Clary Sage']",France,Male,2016,"['Everyday', 'Casual', 'Day', 'Robust', 'Intense', 'Rich', 'Powerful', 'Elegant', 'Autum', 'Generous']"
