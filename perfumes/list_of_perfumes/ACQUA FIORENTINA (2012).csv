ACQUA FIORENTINA (2012),Creed,FLORAL,FRUITY,"Imagine the dawn of a summer's day in Tuscany. The sky is purple and gold, heralding the break of another long, lazy day. In the distance, the gentle contours of a hill caressed by the fickle breeze, and on that hill, an orchard, tucked beneath the walls of a thousand-year-old village. The sun rises, and everything is bathed in a shimmering renaissance light; the harbinger of harmony. The earth smiles back, newly touched with beauty.","['Carnation', 'Apple', 'Grapefruit', 'Rose', 'Pineapple', 'Plum', 'Bergamot', 'Lemon', 'Cedarwood (Virginia)', 'Sandalwood (India)']",France,Female,2012,"['Everyday', 'Romantic', 'Colourful', 'Exotic', 'Cheerful', 'Happy', 'Optimistic', 'Freedom', 'Joyful', 'Day']"
