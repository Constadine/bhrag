It was also on this site that the couture house's new headquarters was to be established. Thanks to the perfumers, 37 Rue De Bellechasse pays tribute to this simultaneously sacred and sacrilegious atmosphere where the high mass of fashion has replaced religious services.","['Oud / Agarwood', 'Elemi', 'Iris / Orris', 'Benzoin', 'Incense / Olibanum', 'Musk']",France,Unisex,2018,"['Intense', 'Rich', 'Robust', 'Powerful', 'Woody', 'Winter', 'Autum', 'Night', 'Brown', 'Black']"
